# Project Purpose
Originally this boty was designed to verify whether a discord user is a student via the attest feature, but it expanded to be a more general purpose bot after the realisation that there were more features that could be added which weren't offered by existing bots like relaying Monash University news and COVID figures directly from the Victorian Department of Health.

# What does ARIA stand for?
ARIA is actually an abbreviation for the following: 
- (A)dministrate - Provide administrative tools for server
- (R)elay - Relay useful information for users on the server
- (I)dentify - The status of users
- (A)ttest - Verify whether a given user is a Monash University Student

# Contribute
Feel free to fork this bot and add whatever you wish to it.

# Planned Changes
- Overhaul Database implementation/handler which is currently rather primative
- Clean up code
- Work on stability improvements
